This text should give you a little description of a things that you need to turn you attention in the website.

First the HTML structure (divs, investments, classes and ids) was taken as a base from original web site.

Second also some images was taken from the website to keep the wish alert idea, the images that may carry personal information were chandelier (with exception of Leo and Boris pictures).

Third the calendar was delayed from the website because originally it was done using Java Script.

Forth the twitter news part was coped from HTML because it was impossible to create new widget for the not existing website, but you show the understanding of a concept Iâ€™m  propagated the number of posts the the widget shows.

Fifth the widget of YouTube video was changed on created by my self one.
